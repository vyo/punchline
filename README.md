# punchline
Minimum bullshit time tracking. Clock in right from your terminal.

##   Description
Every punchline needs a good project description - wait, no. Let's try again:

This is for people who
  - spend most of their time in terminal/konsole/hyperterm/< your hipster terminal emulator here> 
  - need to keep track of time spent across multiple projects
  - can't be arsed with context switching to yet another tool, UI, or god forbid! Excel
